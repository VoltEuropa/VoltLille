- Can we use Github API to make a CRM providing a text editor to add content to the page (fork = repair, put = pull request)
- Can we have renderjs and SEO = pages need to be standalone, but ideally translateable - how to prevent having to maintaing structure of page x in DE/EN/FR
- What types of data do we publish on the page (can be ERP5-ish, maybe eventually use erp5 as backend, but not now)
- Can we pull data from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram with jIO storages
- How to allow real participation? Still like a publi forum of ideas prefixed before an app to create a political programme. This could/should be decentralized. Too much here for now.
